# PvP META 

It is a incomplete project the backend isnt completed 80% of it is completed but we cant provide it open source so make it your self and just for kind information 
You can find most of the addons on my public repos u can use those. stand alone jars are made for you guys to make it short as possible I hope you give like it. 
Everything takes time and we would appreciate your donation if anyone want to DM me on discord: s765 for hiring purposes this project was left because of conflict
with the another owner. dont worry to DM me even to say thanks lmao it would mean alot to me. 

MY dc username is: s765
