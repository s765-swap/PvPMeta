# TitleMod - Custom Minecraft Title Screen Mod

## Overview
TitleMod is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that replaces the default Minecraft title screen with a custom one. It also includes PvP matchmaking functionality and a kit editor system.

## Security Features

### Server IP Protection
- Server IP addresses are no longer hardcoded in the source code
- IPs are stored in an encrypted configuration file
- The configuration file is automatically generated on first run

### Secure Matchmaking
- SHA-256 fingerprinting for secure matchmaking requests
- Prevents tampering with matchmaking requests
- Adds an extra layer of security for server connections

### Code Obfuscation
- The mod now includes ProGuard for code obfuscation
- Makes reverse engineering more difficult
- Protects sensitive parts of the code

## Configuration

The mod's configuration is stored in `.minecraft/config/titlemod_config.json`. This file is automatically generated on first run with default values.

To configure the mod:

1. Run the game once to generate the config file
2. Edit the config file with your server details
3. Restart the game

**Note:** Do not edit the encrypted values directly. Use the in-game configuration if available.

## Building from Source

### Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Gradle

### Build Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./gradlew build` to build the mod
3. The built JAR file will be in `build/libs/`

### Obfuscation
To build with obfuscation enabled:
1. Run `./gradlew buildObfuscated`
2. The obfuscated JAR will be in `build/libs/` with the `-obfuscated` suffix

This will first build the normal JAR and then create an obfuscated version.
